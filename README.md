# Data Structure and Algorithms

This Data Structures repository was created to help me brush up on my rusty skills. I will be using `Java` throughout this
journey and time permitting, there could be occasional use of other languages. I'm not making any promises here;

I have no idea where it will in the next month or so, but I do hope I can make gradual incremental additions.
For now, I'm just going to start with the core implementation of 
the core common data structures available to study
the inner workings of them and their underlying architecture.

## Data Structures 
I'm going to implement the following tasks and check them as I complete.
- [ ] Arrays
- [x] LinkedList
- [x] Stack using `Dynamic Arrays` 
- [x] Stack using `LinkedList`
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Recursion

### Arrays
